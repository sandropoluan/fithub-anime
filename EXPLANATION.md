When users enter the landing page, they will directly be served with a list of 25 unfiltered anime titles.
This way, the user will immediately know what to expect and what this website provides.

On the top ot the landing page, there is a big search bar that intuitively tells users that they can search any title in the list. 
The way the search bar works is that it will (automatically) immediately try to find the title right after the user stops typing without the need to press the search button; this is for convenience.
There is a Search button to the right of the search bar; this is optional for the user to press, and it can be a fallback mechanism if the automatic function doesn’t work (the user will intuitively press it).

On the very bottom of the landing page, there is a pagination navigator. It will help the user to navigate the pages. 

I want to implement some extended filtering, but unfortunately, I don’t have enough time to do it.
